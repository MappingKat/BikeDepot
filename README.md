##Learning Goals

Our goals are to understand how web applicationsâ€¦

1.  Receive requests and send responses with HTTP
2.  Store data to and fetch data from a SQL database
3.  Are built in a modular, object-oriented style

This project is a bridge between smaller projects with Sinatra like WebGuesser and IdeaBox to Rails-based projects like Blogger and SalesEngine.

##Setup

1. Clone the repo
 ``` git clone git@github.com: MappingKat\BikeDepot ```

2. Install gems 
 ``` bundle ```


##Deploying

This is a Sinatra application with a rakefile. 

To deploy this app, please 

``` rackup ```

Then go and visit your localhost at port 9292

``` localhost:9292 ```


#####Thank you!
