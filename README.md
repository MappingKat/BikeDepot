##Learning Goals

Our goals are to understand how web applicationsâ€¦

* Receive requests and send responses with HTTP
* Store data to and fetch data from a SQL database
* Are built in a modular, object-oriented style

This project is a bridge between smaller projects with Sinatra like WebGuesser and IdeaBox to Rails-based projects like Blogger and SalesEngine.

##How To Deploy


This is a Sinatra application with a rakefile. 

To deploy this app, please 

``` rackup ```

Then go and visit your localhost at port 9292

<<< localhost:9292 >>>

Thank you!
